			<p>When someone loses their identity but seeks acceptance, they rely on a superficial image of one’s self, driven by materialism, and transform themselves into someone far away from their true selves– so far that they cannot remember where they started. One such character in Spirited Away is No-Face. He is not welcomed in the bathhouse as he is not a god, but a spirit wandering around without purpose. Incapable of talking, he always stands on the edge of a frame, but his creepiness draws viewers' eyes even though he does not have much of a presence in the story until he turns into a monster filled with greed. No-Face, by observation, learns to produce gold to be accepted by others. However, at the same time, he becomes arrogant and turns into a greedy monster– he has gained what he wanted and now wants more. In front of the giant bug-like creature that is almost ten times bigger than her, Sen calmly sits on her heels and fearlessly rejects his offer of gold by insisting that he cannot give her what she wants– her parents. When being rejected by Sen, No-Face cries “I’m lonely. I’m lonely,” because he is deprived of the sense of belonging to society. Chihiro throws a dark green emetic dumpling into his enormous mouth, which causes him to vomit and gradually turns him back into his original form– voiceless, powerless, and half-transparent. By showing the idea of cleansing and returning to the original state –or No-Face himself– Miyazaki might have intended to demonstrate that the answer is always in “yourself,” and you cannot find your answer by pretending to be someone else.</p>

			<p>While Miyazaki criticizes people’s greed throughout the film, he also suggests that we have to work for a living and illustrates that people are deprived of a sense of self and purpose as they work hard for money in a conformed society, like Japan. In the world of Spirited Away, working is necessary as Haku tells Chihiro, “If you don't get a job, Yubāba will turn you into an animal.” Chihiro consistently begs Yubāba to let her work at the bathhouse, and when she finally convinces her, a piece of paper floats to Chihiro. With an immature handwriting, Chihiro signs the contract, “荻野千尋 (Chihiro Ogino).” Looking at the contract with a dissatisfied expression, Yubāba makes three of the characters float into her hands and grab them. It leaves “千 (Sen)” on the contract, and Yubāba says with satisfaction, “it belongs to me now. From now on, your name is Sen.” The next morning, Chihiro has already forgotten that her actual name is Chihiro until Haku reminds her, “Yubāba rules others by stealing their names. You are Sen here, but keep your real name a secret.” This contract scene depicts the oppressing higher power which forces people to conform to their expectations and norms, even if that means taking away one’s authentic identity. Yubāba’s absolute control over her employees in Spirited Away and her action of taking away their names –identities– reflects conformity in Japanese society, where people are pressured to lie to their genuine feelings to maintain the collective identity, causing them to forget their inner self,  as Chihiro forgets her real identity when she is obediently brainwashed to be “Sen” by Yubāba. Perhaps, Miyazaki wishes that Haku’s reminder to always remember her true identity urges not only Chihiro but also others in Japanese society to have their own purpose even in a conformed society. </p>
