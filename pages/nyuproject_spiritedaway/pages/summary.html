			<p>Spirited Away, a 2001 Studio Ghibli film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, follows the journey of Chihiro, a young girl moving to a new town, who ends up in a mysterious world of gods and spirits after her family stumbles upon an abandoned tunnel. Ignoring Chihiro’s fear, her father keeps walking inside the tunnel, and Chihiro follows, clinging to her mother. Lured by the smell of food, Chihiro’s parents eat at one of the food stalls in the deserted town beyond the tunnel, which causes them to turn into pigs. To find a way to turn them back to humans, Chihiro signs a contract with the antagonist Yubāba, a huge wrinkly lady with intimidating eyes covered with lavender eyeshadow, and starts working at her bathhouse, being renamed “Sen.” Haku, with emerald bobbed hair, warns Sen, “If you completely forget [your name], you'll never find your way home.” With carefully detailed animation, Miyazaki creates an immersive experience in which viewers can grow with Chihiro. However, the film is not only about the life-changing journey of a girl in fantasy but also a depiction of Japanese culture and behavior prevalent around the time the film was made. With the use of delicate, hand-drawn animation, Miyazaki depicts Japanese society after the economic bubble, when the idea of materialism was widespread and the value of individuality started to vanish. Miyazaki, through Spirited Away, urges the viewers to remember what they should truly value even under societal pressure to conform. </p>
