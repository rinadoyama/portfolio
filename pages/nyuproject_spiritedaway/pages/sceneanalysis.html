			<p>Given that Chihiro and her parents are living in Japan after the bubble economy, the viewers could assume that her parents lived through the bubble economy which would explain their behavior towards money and consumption. Beyond the tunnel lies a town filled with oddity, but Chihiro is the only one who can sense the weirdness: without questioning, Chihiro’s parents eat food that was not meant for them and turn into fat greedy pigs. Even though Chihiro understands that it is immoral to eat at a food stall in the absence of workers or cooks, her parents start pigging out and try to solve it with money, as her father insists, “Don’t worry, your father’s here. I got credit cards and cash.” On the other hand, Chihiro is innocent and does not show any interest in money or luxury throughout the film. An article on nippon.com, which provides scholarly analysis and articles on the Japanese economy, contrasts each generation before and after the economic bubble and explains that the Relaxed Education Generation, compared to the Bubble Generation,  “is also seen as less materialistic, without the same desire for brand-name goods and fast cars seen in their elders” (“Japanese Generations”). Assuming that Chihiro is 10 years old in 2001, she was born during the “Relaxed Education Generation,” which is between 1987 and 2004, when work-life balance was emphasized, and people valued time outside of work with their family and friends. The contrast between Chihiro and her parents’ behaviors toward materialistic possessions contributes to Miyazaki’s disapproval of materialism and encouragement to value what you already have.  </p>
