			<p>Spirited Away takes place in Japan after the economic bubble burst in the late ‘90s or the early 2000s, and illustrates the materialism, conformity, and work structures during that period. At the beginning of the film, Chihiro's father, looking at the town beyond the tunnel, mentions, “It’s an abandoned theme park. They built them everywhere in the early ‘90s. Then the economy went bad, and they all went bankrupt.” This alludes to the bubble economy, also known as the Japanese asset price bubble, which is the period between 1986 and 1991 when the asset value skyrocketed, and the Japanese economy was prosperous. During that time, the employment rate was high, so everyone worked hard and became rich. Robert L. Cutts, in his article published by Harvard Business Review, explores people’s behaviors toward money and claims that as Japan had “a virtually endless source of cash flowing right out of the ground at their feet—and encounter no risk or any other discomforting accountabilities in spending it,” people spent a lot of money on leisure and clothes to live a luxurious life instead of saving. People during this time were highly driven by extrinsic motivation, which blinded them to their own core values. </p>
